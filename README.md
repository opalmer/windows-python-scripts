Windows Python Scripts and Setup
================================

This code can be used to setup multiple installations of Python on a 
Windows host.  It was originally intended to setup a build machine 
but could be targeted for other uses too.

Requirements
============

This repository requires a few things to be preinstalled on
the Windows system:

* curl (binary should be on %PATH%)
* 7-zip

There are some hard coded paths in the scripts however 
most of them can be easily modified.
